                <h2>All about me</h2>
                <p>     Hello! My name is David Boman and welcome to the about me page on my website! I am a junior at Michigan State University and I major in Information Science. I was initially a Computer Science major but decided to change after realizing that I hate coding and did not want to do that for the rest of my life. However, I still would like to pursue a career in the tech industry. </p>
                <p>     Outside of school, I love to work with my computer. I have had the same PC for about five years now, and have been steadily adding parts and upgrading it along the way. I pride myself on being able to run any game on the max settings, no matter what. I normally use my computer to play games with my friends online, but also use it to do homework like I am right now.</p>
                <p>     I am currently employed at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor. I know it doesn’t make a lot of sense for me to be working there and going to school here at a rival school, but it pays well so I’m fine with it. At work, I am a clerk, so I do a lot of the behind-the-scenes things at the hospital. Things like calling to get rooms cleaned, admitting and discharging patients in the system, and generally helping out the nurses is what I do. The job can be pretty slow at times, which is great because it gives me time to get some homework done on the job.</p>

                            <li>Location 1: We stayed at a lake house owned by one of my friends family</li>
                            <li>Location 2: We spent the day at Macinac Island and biked around the island</li>
                            <li>Location 3: We did a bunch of things around town (my favorite was the mystery spot)</li>
                            <li>Location 4: We went to Sleeping Bear Dunes on the way home</li>
